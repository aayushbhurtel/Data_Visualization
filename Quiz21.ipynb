        "=> In the John Snow's map of cholera outbreak, John used bars to show the number of dead people based on their location. We can see that the number of death cases is more in and around broad street in the map. Carefully looking at the zoomed picture of this map, I could see that there is a water pump in the intersection of broadway street and cambridge street. At the same spot, the concentration of death due to cholera is more dense. Due to this reason, John Snow may have tested the water from these pump and concluded that people drinking water from these pumps are infected with cholera and that could be the reason for death of thousands of people.\n",
